## Write Once, Feel Wrong Everywhere

[Very interesting article](http://iconoclastlabs.com/cms/blog/posts/phonegap-vs-rubymotion) comparing [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com) and [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com):

RubyMotion may be good, but I will continue coding in Objective-C, with Xcode for iOS. Just use the native tool of your platform and the native language and you will create the best experience for you app: Objective-C on iOS, Java on Android, C# on Windows Phone etc... Learning the language is not the difficult part, especially if you're a developer. What's difficult is learning the frameworks, and the convention of the platform. You will spend more time fighting with UIKit or CoreData than having issues with Objective-C and this will not change if you code your app in Ruby.
