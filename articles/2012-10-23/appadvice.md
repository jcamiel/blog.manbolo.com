[AppAdvice](http://appadvice.com) is a really cool website on app recommendations, with tons of iOS app reviews, apps lists, editorial picks and news in the world on iPhone and iPad. They have even [a beautiful universal app](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/appadvice/id364906378?mt=8) on iPhone, one of the best app recommendation apps on iOS.  

We're trying to get a review for our [new 1.5 version of Meon](https://itunes.apple.com/app/meon/id400274934?mt=8) from AppAdvice, and while we were contacting them, we received this automatic mail to acknowledge that AppAdvice has receive our initial mail. So funny, it makes me really smile!
Small details like that show how the team is dedicated to its product.

It's cool to see the human behind the Robot that pretends to be human!
