Surely, the `UICollectionView` sessions at the WWDC were the most impressive and coolest sessions. Be sure to watch the videos [Introducing Collection Views](https://deimos.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/BrowsePrivately/adc.apple.com.16351493766.016351493772.16495242545?i=1178093106) and [Advanced Collection Views and Building Custom Layouts](https://deimos.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/BrowsePrivately/adc.apple.com.16351493766.016351493772.16495242571?i=1190436598). If you develop on iOS, now you _have_ to master `UICollectionView`.
