## Architects ?

From [Deep Shah](http://www.gitshah.com/), in [Be a Programmer not an Architect!](http://www.gitshah.com/2010/09/be-programmer-not-architect.html):

> A lot of architects that I have met, have stopped doing active programming. 
> Most of their time is spend in attending meetings, calls and drawing some 
> pretty diagrams. 
> 
> __You might think whats wrong with that?__
>
> Well, I think (and these are strictly my views), If someone is not in touch with
> programming then how can he/she suggest a sane solution to any technical problem?
>
> If someone has left programming years ago then
> 
> - How can he/she solve any technical problem? 
> - How can he/she visualize that there is going to be a technical problem 
> implementing a solution that he/she is suggesting?
>
> I think answer to all of the above questions is, they can't!
>
> And I am making these claims out of personal experience.

Don't miss its companion [The Ivory Tower Architect](http://www.gitshah.com/2011/01/ivory-tower-architect.html). Deep Shah's blog is very interesting because it is not tied to any particular technology/language. You will find articles on Ruby, C#, Android and so on...

Also, very good serie on Git and Git on SVN, in a real production environment:

- [GIT - Version control done the right way - Part - 1](http://www.gitshah.com/2010/11/git-version-control-done-right-way-part.html)
- [GIT - Version control done the right way - Part - 2](http://www.gitshah.com/2010/11/git-version-control-done-right-way-part_21.html)
- [How to use GIT with SVN repositories](http://www.gitshah.com/2010/11/how-to-use-git-with-subversion-svn.html)
- [How to use GIT with non standard SVN repository layouts](http://www.gitshah.com/2010/11/how-to-use-git-with-non-standard-svn.html)
- [How to work on multiple streams of work with GIT over SVN](http://www.gitshah.com/2010/12/how-to-work-on-multiple-streams-of-work.html)

Added to my Google Reader's.
