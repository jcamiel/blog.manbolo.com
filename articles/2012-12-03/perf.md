## Android Performance Case Study by Romain Guy

Nice counterpart to [Using Xcode OpenGL ES Frame Capture][], by [Romain Guy][] in [Android Performance Case Study][]:

The cool stuff is that you can inspect performances of any apps, even those which you don't have the source code. There is no question that, on mobile OS, Android and iOS are far ahead the other operating systems: the battle is on the number of apps available in the store, the apps quality, the overall user experience (sharing between apps, cloud syncing etc..). But you can't deliver a good app without good __and free__ tools...
