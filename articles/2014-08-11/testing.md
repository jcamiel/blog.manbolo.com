## Testing on iOS / OSX: There Is an Apple Framework for That

[The new issue of objc.io][] is about Testing. Really a good new issue with a lot of interesting stuff. Being in the iOS development since 5-6 years, I've seen testing to be taken more and more seriously, if not by third parties, certainly by Apple. 

But, man, 8 articles on testing on iOS, and not _only one mention of UIAutomation_, the core Apple framework for UI testing... Really?

If you want more information on UIAutomation (now spelled _UI Automation_ by Apple), I recommend you the top read article on our blog [iOS Automated Tests with UIAutomation][]. It's a little dated, but I think it's still a good base for learning UIAutomation.

What I love about UIAutomation is that it depends on accessibility: to be able to test your user interface, you have to make it accessible. So clever!
