A few days ago, I've received [my iPad mini sleeve][] by [Joli Originals][]. The funny thing is that I was almost more excited about my Joli sleeve than my iPad mini <img src="smile.png" class="inline" style="vertical-align:middle; width:24px; height:24px;"/>! 
I'm a huge fan of Joli cases: handmade, done with high quality leather and wool, with a simple and elegant design, they are simply gorgeous!

Joli sleeves have a huge fan base, and reading [the feedbacks page][] is impressive:
