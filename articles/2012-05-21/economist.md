## The Economist on Mobile Apps

[Nice interview of Nick Blunden](http://www.fiercemobilecontent.com/story/economists-mobile-chief-explains-move-apples-newsstand-html5/2012-05-15), about The Economist strategy on mobile web:

> Going forward, at the moment our view is that HTML5 doesn't quite have the
> same capabilities to create a compelling user experience as native apps in iOS
> and Android have. It is much harder in HTML5 to create that really compelling
> immersive lean back experience and over time that will change. There are
> companies that are pushing the boundaries of HTML5, and in the future it will 
> be a technology that enables publishers to very efficiently and effectively 
> publish content across different platforms. I just don't think we're there
> yet. So I think we're going to try to push it as hard as we can, but our view
> at this moment of time is that you can create a more compelling experience in
> native apps.

Automatic download of content with [Newsstand](http://www.apple.com/ios/features.html#newsstand) seems also to be a big opportunity for digital content providers.
