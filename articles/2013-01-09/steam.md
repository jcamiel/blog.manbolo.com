## The Verge Interviews Valve's Gabe Newell on Steam Box

[Pretty exciting interview of Gabe Newell][] on Valve's Steam Box, by [The Verge][] (thanks Guillaume!). XBox and XBox Live are huge part of Microsoft entertainment and devices strategy, and Microsoft has sold [more than 70 million of XBox 360 since 2005][], making it the [9th best selling console game of all time][]. Valve ready to launch a Steam box should worry Microsoft at least.

Also, as usual, some Windows 8 bashing:
 
> Windows 8 was like this giant sadness. It just hurts everybody in the PC 
> business. Rather than everybody being all excited to go buy a new PC, buying 
> new software to run on it, we’ve had a 20+ percent decline in PC sales — it’s
> like "holy cow that’s not what the new generation of the operating system is
> supposed to do." There’s supposed to be a 40 percent uptake, not a 20 percent
> decline, so that’s what really scares me. When I started using it I was like
> "oh my god..." I find [Windows 8] unusable.
