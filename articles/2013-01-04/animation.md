## Best of 2012: UI Animations by Beautiful Pixels

One of the domain where iOS really shines is animations. Developers are pushing the limits to find new and innovative animations in iOS apps and [Beautiful Pixels][] has selected some of them in [Best of 2012: UI Animations:][]. From [Google+][] apps to [National Parks][], each of these apps uses cool animations that add to the app value. [Twitterrific 5][]'s pull-to-refresh animation, while not technically impressive, is really _cute_.

[Core Animation][], the iOS framework for UI animations, is really powerful, you can even do 3D animations and particles effect (starting from iOS 5) - see the demos in the WWDC 2011 [Core Animation Essentials][] session. There are other good WWDC videos on Core Animations:
 
- WWDC 2010:
	- [Building Animation Driven Interfaces][]
	- [Core Animation in Practice, Part 1][]
	- [Core Animation in Practice, Part 2][]
- WWDC 2011:
	- [Core Animation Essentials][]
- WWDC 2012
	- [Optimizing 2D Graphics and Animation Performance][]
