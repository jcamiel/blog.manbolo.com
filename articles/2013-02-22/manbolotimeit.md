We're proud to announce our second app on Google Play, [Time It!][].
__Time It!__ is a clean and elegant personal time tracker: there are other time trackers but none of them were suitable for us; we just wanted someting simple _and_ efficient. So, we did it!

We'll be happy to have feedback on this 1.0, 
<a href="mailto:contact@manbolo.com?Subject=Time%20It">don't hesitate to mail us</a>, we'll be happy to improve our new app!
