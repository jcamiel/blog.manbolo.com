## Respect the Platform

So true. I think the first and most important thing when designing apps for a particular platform is to _respect the platform_. You must know the platform ergonomics and UI conventions; a generic and theoric Design Knowledge doesn't prevent you from knowing the platform and embrace its core experience. Textures on Game Center and [Skeuomorphic Design](http://madebymany.com/blog/apples-aesthetic-dichotomy) don't please you? This is your right, but these are the norm on iOS. You can play outside the rules but you have to know them.

Another important point when building and designing your app is to iterate. Effective prototyping is so simple now that you have to build your design with a live demo, test it with real users and iterate on feedbacks.
