## Social Login Buttons Aren’t Worth It by MailChimp

Quite funny, we just have this discussion this morning: we ask ourself if one should propose a Facebook or Twitter login while designing a new login page. [MailShimp][] in [Social Login Buttons Aren’t Worth It][] gives some really good reasons (and analytics) not to use social login buttons:

> Sometimes you log in with Twitter, sometimes with Facebook, sometimes with
> a username and password specific to that app. It’s hard enough to remember 
> your username and password, let alone which service you should bloody use
> to log in. As you add login buttons to a page, you also add decision points
> for users, while creating visual complexity in your design. The marginal 
> gains in login rate are chipped away by the additional cognitive load you’re 
> adding for your users.
>       
> [...] 
>     
> Is it worth it? Nope, it’s not to us.
