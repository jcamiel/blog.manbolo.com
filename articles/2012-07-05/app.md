## ballon paperApp: a Little Gem in the App Store

Sometimes, you dig into the App Store, far beyond the top 100 apps, and you will discover a very beautiful gem. [ballon paperApp](http://itunes.apple.com/app/balloon-paperapp/id495904729?mt=8) is one of them, excessively original and poetic.

I've ordered the book from [les Ã©ditions volumiques](http://www.volumique.com/shop), and looking forward to play with it.
