## Samsung Xpress M2875FW, a Really Good and Affordable AirPrint Laser Printer  

__Updated on 2014/02/11:__ The Samsung Xpress M2875FW can have compatibility issues with iOS 8. If you're not able to print from an iOS 8 device, try the suggestions in [Samsung Xpress M2875FW / AirPrint iOS 8 Compatibility Issues][], it has worked for me.

If you're looking for a good [AirPrint][] laser printer __and__ affordable, the [Samsung Xpress M2875FW][] is for you. There are a lot of cheap AirPrint inkjets, but due to the price of ink cartridges, I have been looking for a good laser printer.

My wish list was:

- laser printer
- multifunction (scan, copy, print)
- AirPrint support out-of-the box, to be able to print from my iPhone, iPad and MacBook Pro
- monochrome (no need to color print)
- duplex printing is not mandatory, but a plus
- affordable (less than $200: laser printers used to cost more, but the print cost of a single page is lower)
- relatively small

After a lot of researches, I've found a printer that answers to each point of my  wish list: the [Samsung Xpress M2875FW][]. The Samsung Xpress M2875FW is an affordable (currently [$189.99 on Amazon][], subject to price change) multi-function printer, with AirPrint support, duplex printing and relatively small (15.8 x 14.3 x 14.4 inches / 40.3 x 36.3 x 36.6 cm):

When doing my researches, I tried to find how good was the support of AirPrint for each possible printer. I wanted to be able to have a built-in support, and I  discarded any printer that allow printing only from a third party app. If you want to be sure that you future printer will support AirPrint out-of-the-box, my advise is to check [this official list of AirPrint printers by Apple][].

[The Amazon page of the M2875FW][] indicates that there is a newer model, [the M2885FW][], but as this newer model was not listed on the Apple AirPrint support page, I have preferred to try and buy the M2875FW. The printer has been really easy to setup (on my MacBook Pro on Mavericks), you just have to launch the Samsung install CD and follow the instructions for AirPrint. Once the printer is installed on the MacBook Pro, printing from any iPhone or iPad is immediate, with no-setup. It's kind of magic (like all the other Air technologies, [AirDrop][] and [AirPlay][]).

I'm really happy with my new printer and can't recommend it enough. The only minus point is the cost of Samsung toners, that are above the average laser toners (around 10c / page); on the other hand, the M2875FW has an eco mode, but I haven't finished a full toner to check the real cost.
