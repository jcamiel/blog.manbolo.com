[Too sad][].

[Giger][] is, in my opinion, one of the most influencal artist of the 20st century. If you've ever seen [Alien][], [Poltergeist II][], [Species][], [Prometheus][],
you've seen his disturbing work. A great artist is gone, one of my favorist.

In [Thank You for the Nightmares: Hans Rudolf Giger, 1940 – 2014][]:

> When I was about 5 years old my father got a human skull. That was something special. 
> I was very young, and it was a little frightening. But I was proud to have a skull. 
> My interest in skulls and bones came very early.

If you travel in Switzerland, near [Gruyères][], spend some time in the [H. R. Giger Museum][], it really worth it.

And take some times to play to [Dark Seed][]:
