## RESTful Series by Mugunth Kumar

Mugunth Kumar has just started a serie on [RESTful API Server - Doing it the right way](http://blog.mugunthkumar.com/articles/restful-api-server-doing-it-the-right-way-part-1/):

> Success of a startup depends on the success of their product, whether it’s 
> their iOS app or their service or their API. In my past 3 years, I’ve worked 
> on a variety of iOS apps (mostly for startups) consuming web services and in 
> this blog, I’ve tried to consolidate my knowledge and show you the best 
> practices that you should adopt when developing a RESTful API.

I'm looking forward to the next articles of this serie on RESTful. [As I've already said](http://blog.manbolo.com/2012/01/04/asihttprequest-is-dead.-long-live-mknetworkkit), Mugunth is the author of very interesting and powerful frameworks, like [MKNetworkKit](http://blog.mugunthkumar.com/products/ios-framework-introducing-mknetworkkit) and [MKStoreKit](http://blog.mugunthkumar.com/coding/using-mkstorekit-in-your-apps/). Looking at our blog stats, there are some people that are looking for MKNetworkKit ressources, so I believe that the framework is gaining some momentum among iOS developers.

Speaking of RESTful, [RESTful Web Services](http://www.amazon.com/Restful-Web-Services-Leonard-Richardson/dp/0596529260) from Leonard Richardson & Sam Ruby, is a very good book on this subject. Lot of real examples, where Leonard compares the theory and the practice (with Flickr, Amazon S3 etc...).
