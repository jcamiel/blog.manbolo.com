![Evoland splashscreen][]

Really super cool project from [Shiro Games][]: [Evoland][]. [Evoland][] is a RPG that aim to revisit RPG games history. The player will travel from retro 8-bit graphics to modern 3D. The game is now [available on Steam for Windows and Mac][], and should be available on iOS.

I love the graphics, and the pitch is terrific! Brilliant idea!

[Shiro Games][] has been founded by [Sebastien Vidal][] and [Nicolas Cannasse][]. Nicolas has an impressive technical background, 
he has developed [Haxe][], an open source multi-platform programming language.
Shiro Games is an independant game company based in Bordeaux: what's cool is that Manbolo headquarter is also located in Bordeaux! Guys, if you need helps on iOS (even beta testing), we will be happy to give you a hand!
