This comment by the [creator of Prince of Persia himself][] shows how great are [Fabien Sanglard][]'s articles. Be aware: [Prince of Persia is now under Fabien's retro engineering super powers][]. 

From [Doom][], [Another World][], [Duke Nukem 3D][] to [Quake 3][], Fabien did a lot of impressive, detailed, explained, and marvellous code reviews on these mythical hits. Fabien shows how imaginative and creative had to be a video game's creator in these archaeological days!
