## iPad Keyboard Improvments

From [Andy Ihnatko in Apple's post-PC world](http://www.macworld.co.uk/blogs/?entryid=3348320&blogid=8):

I love my iPad and if you look at [all the available text editor on iPad](http://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/), it's quite obvious that content generation (and obviously text content) is big on iPad. With iOS 6 coming, Apple must improve the keyboard support on iPad:

1. By improving the hardware keyboard support: switching between apps from the hardware keyboard, improving text selection etc...
2. By improving the build-in software keyboard: if you look at this video, you can see [how the software keyboard could be used as a trackpad for quick text selection](http://danielhooper.tumblr.com/) (Thanks to [Daniel Hooper](https://twitter.com/#!/danielchooper))

The 'Undo' feature is also very very awkward on iPad: shake your iPad to undo some typo doesn't work. I dislike this undo gesture on iPhone too by the way.
