## Path of Anger

[Path](http://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/path/id403639508) has been the only social app I wanted to use. Because it was so delightful to use, so beautiful, so simple.

Now, [it appears that the app was silently sniffing your whole address book and saving it on its servers](http://blog.path.com/post/17274932484/we-are-sorry). Such a shame.

Even if the Path developers have excused themselves and erase all private data, I have deleted the app from my iPhone and will never use it again.

Now, Apple has to update the Address Book API so an app that uses your Address Book should automatically prompt and ask for your consent, as for the user location.
