## Meon Soundtrack by Benjamin Devos

[Speaking of awesome video game soundtracks][], I love musics in Meon. When working on [Meon][], we did the graphics ourselves, it was a lot of work, especially when Retina devices appeared. When we begun to work on the soundtracks, we decided to hire a real professional composer.

If you want to make a game, here is my best advice: __hire professional graphics and music composers__, don't waste time and energy on graphics and musics, just work with people that know much about it than you. You will spend more money for sure, but the result will be greater.

I'm so glad we have found the right person for Meon soundtracks: [Benjamin Devos][]. Benjamin has done a wonderful work, and the result is simply excellent.
