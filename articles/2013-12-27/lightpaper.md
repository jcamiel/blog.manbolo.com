## LightPaper, a free OSX Markdown Editor

[LightPaper][] is a simple, beautiful, powerful and free text editor for OSX. I've just test it a few minutes but I already love it. It works __especially__ well if you're writing in [Markdown][].

Under the cover, [blog.manbolo.com][] is a static generated blog. It uses a small PHP script to generate the entire blog each time we add new articles (the generation of the entire blog lasts less than 1s). Each article is a Markdown file (you can see the original Markdown file by appending .md at the end of an article url like this <http://blog.manbolo.com/2013/12/04/uialertview-bug-on-ios-7.md>).

Writing a new article with [LightPaper][] is a real pleasure. The killer features for me:

- live HTML rendering of your text, 
- can open a bunch of Markdown files folder, 
- really fast, light, and feel _modern OSX_.

I used to write with the venerable [BBEdit][] but [LightPaper][] has become my favorite tool for Markdown writing. Well down [Clockwork Engine][]!

[LightPaper][] is free but I wouldn't mind to pay a few bucks for such a great editor. There is also [an Android version][], can't wait for the iOS one.
