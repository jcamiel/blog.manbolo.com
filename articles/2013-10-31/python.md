## Exedore, an OSX Native Python IDE

_Whouah!_ [A bargain at $9.99][] (or 7â‚¬59) (via [Michael Tsai][]) !

[Exedore][] is very fast to launch, totally native and has the same look as Xcode 4.x. This is a pretty strong 0.1.1 version which includes:

- A full-featured Python text editor with syntax highlighting, code auto-completion,
- An integrated Python debugger with graphical breakpoints and a console for stepping through and debugging scripts,
- Python documentation integrated

I've tested some of my Python scripts and I'm impressed by this editor/debugger. This is going to be my go-to IDE for Python scripting. I'm currently using [PyCharm][] which is a rock solid Python IDE, with lot of features (like [PEP 8][] live validation, support for [virtualenv][], etc..). But for little projects, PyCharm seems a bit overkill (and also have a small smell of Java apps...).

Exedore is in its enfancy, but it shows a lot of promises. I really hope [Todd Ditchendorf][] will keep improving it and add features while keeping it simple and fast.

What I would like to have for the next versions:

- possibility to set a page column guide,
- virtualenv support (I've tried to set a different `python` executable in the project settings but I have the impression that it is not working), 
- the same key bindings for step-in, step-out and continue as Xcode,
- a Xcode 5 look-and-feel (currently, it's more a 4.x look-and-feel),
- a side window for the doc.

Overall, I strongly recommend you to try [Exedore][], if you're in the [Python Way of Life][].
