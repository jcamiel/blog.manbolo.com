## iOS 7 Expanded Bluetooth Support

I was aware of some new bluetooth support in iOS 7 but [Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS)][] has completely flown under the radar for me.

> The purpose of the Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS) is to give Bluetooth accessories 
> (that connect to iOS devices through a Bluetooth low-energy link) a simple and convenient way
> to access many kinds of notifications that are generated on iOS devices.
>
> The ANCS is designed around three principles: simplicity, efficiency and scalability. As a result,
> accessories ranging from simple LEDs to powerful “companion” devices with large displays can find the service useful.

Combined with [Application State Preservation and Restoration][], developers can create apps that run in background, exchange 
data with Bluetooth peripherals without the need of user intervention.

I completely miss this!

Really, too smoke for not having a new Apple smart device really soon...
