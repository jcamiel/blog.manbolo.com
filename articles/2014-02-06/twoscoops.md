## Two Scoops of Django 1.6

[Daniel Greenfeld][] and [Audrey Roy][] have just released a revised edition of [Two Scoops of Django, Best Pratices for Django 1.6][]. 

I've been a huge fan of the first edition (targeted to Django 1.5), it has been (and still is) an invaluable companion in learning how to develop with [Django][]. The first edition contains a lot of tips, tricks, patterns, code snippets, techniques and more important best practices: how to organize your settings, how to design your models, how to test your Django app etc...

In my opinion, this is not a book for starting to learn Django: it's value is really in the knowlegde and experiences that Daniel and Audrey have learned over the years, it's about _best practices_. If you're new to Django, this book will be challenging, you should at least have gone through the [Django tutorial][]. 

But if you plan to use Django in your projects, [Two Scoops of Django, Best Pratices for Django 1.6][] is simply __a must-to-read__.

You can buy it on [Amazon][] or on [Daniel and Audrey's online shop][].

Did I say I love Django?

I love Django.

I love Python.
