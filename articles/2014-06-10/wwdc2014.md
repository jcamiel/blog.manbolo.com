## Swift Year Zero

This has been the most important WWDC since the introduction of the iPhone SDK, 6 years ago. 

On the really incredible amount of new features, for both developers and users,  I will highlight two things: 

__1: App Extensions.__ Think of it as a mini version of your app that can be opened in the context of an another app. Today, in Safari, you can share links with Twitter and Facebook: when you share an URL, a small dialog appears, this is an _extension_ of Twitter or Facebook, inside Safari. With iOS 8, any app can appear in this sharing menu and have a small interface _inside Safari_, to process the current web page. This is not limited to Safari, but in fact __any apps__ can use extensions provided by your app. It's really a secure and easy way to seamlessly share datas between apps.

I think that App Extensions will completely modify the way we use and develop apps, a lot of new features are now possible: [we stand today on the edge of a New Frontier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Frontier) for iOS!

__2 : Swift, of course.__ I really like Objective-C, the grammar is very small, and there has been a number of really good additions to streamline the development like [ARC][] and [Objects literals][]. Now, we have a brand new language, designed to be the iOS / OSX developers _lingua franca_ for the next 10-15 years, and I'm a little scared! Swift looks modern and brilliant with function as first class citizens, a REPL, inferred type, a powerful case pattern matching, tupples etc... But it's the _unknown_...

We're at the Year Zero of this new language and I'm a little afraid to leave behind me a really good friend. 

And, of course, I'm also excited: it's so good to be an iOS developer!
