## Android Instapaper Contest

[Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/2011/12/07/standing-up-for-android) launches the Android Instapaper Contest:
> If you make the first great Android Instapaper client that:
>
> - uses the official API
> - contains a significant portion of the iOS app’s features, the details of which we’d work out privately
> - runs on a wide variety of Android devices and OS versions including modern
> smartphones, the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet, and whichever 10” tablet matters
> at the time of completion
> - is priced at $2.99 or higher in the U.S. with approximately equivalent pricing 
> elsewhere, and satisfies requirements to be sold in the Google Marketplace,
> Amazon Appstore, and whatever B&N uses for the Nook Tablet
>
> I’ll call it the official Instapaper app for Android, I’ll promote it on the
> Instapaper site, I’ll drop the subscription requirement for its API access,
> you’ll answer all support email that comes from it, and we’ll split the net
> revenue 50/50.

If I were as fluent in Java / Android as I'm in Objective-C / Cocoa Touch, I would try right now to participate to this Instapaper contest. I'm a huge fan of [Instapaper](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208) but I don't see anything in this app that couldn't be done, with the same Love, on Android. On iOS, Instapaper is universal, so developers already have a base UI for mobile phones and tablets. I'm rather sure that, in the next two-three months, someone  (maybe from Google?) will developp a brilliant Instapaper app that will satisfy Marco. 

If this is the case, we may have real figures to compare app sales between Android and iOS. Marco Arment has the habit of releasing useful data for developers on his blog, like the [iOS versions you should support](http://www.marco.org/2011/11/30/more-ios-device-and-os-version-stats-from-instapaper) and I think he will give us some data.

Looking forward to the [next Build & Analyse episodes](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze)...
